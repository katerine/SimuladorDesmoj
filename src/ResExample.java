/**
 * This is the model class. It is the main class of a simple process-oriented
 * model of the quay of a container terminal using resources to represent berths.
 * It focuses on the allocation of berths (docking space at a quay) to incoming
 * container ships. There are eight equal-sized berths on the quay in question.
 * Every time a ship arrives it tries to allocate one, two, or three of these
 * berths depending on its size. If there is enough space available, the
 * container ship docks and starts unloading its freight. Otherwise, it has to
 * wait in a queue until other ships leave the port and free the occupied berths.
